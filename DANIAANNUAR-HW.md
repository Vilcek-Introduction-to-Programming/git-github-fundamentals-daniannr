From last week's class, I've learned what a repository is and how to connect it to your local computer, what pull requests and committing changes are, and using GitHub in general to organize your scripts or code changes. I still do not know most of the features that Git or GitHub offer, especially how to collaborate with other people and the best practices on arranging your scripts or code on your GitHub folder. It would be great to learn how to best organize our work on GitHub for easy access and as our own portfolio.  

One of the ways Wilson et. al. suggested for computational reproducibility is project organization such that files should be organized in a logical and consistent directory structure so you and others can keep track of them.  Each project should have its own directory.  Text documents including manuscripts, documentation for source code or lab notebook shouldbe in the "doc" directory. Raw data and metadata should be in a "data"" directory while files including tables or figured generated after any form of analysis should be in the "results" directory.  The source code should be in the "src" directory where it contains all of the code written for the project.  This directory can be organized into two groups. The first is any code that is involved in data cleaning or statistical analyses.  The second group can be scripts that contain all the analysis steps for the entire project, with specific commands for specific files.  The "bin" directory should contain code from the "src" directory.  The file naming should always reflect their content or function, and there should always be a readme file to explain the contents of the project directory.
